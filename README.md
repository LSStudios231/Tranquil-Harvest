# Tranquil Harvest — Mobile Game

**Tranquil Harvest** is a 2D farming-style mobile game where the player grows crops, harvests them, and sells them for profit. The economy loop revolves around reinvesting earnings into better seeds to increase crop value.

## Gameplay Overview
The player spawns on an open field and interacts with the world using different tools:

- Chop trees with an axe to gather wood
- Use a hoe to till the soil
- Plant seeds and wait for them to grow (~5 minutes)
- Harvest crops and sell them to earn money
- Purchase higher–tier seeds to increase income

The game includes a full inventory system where items, tools, and seeds are stored and managed by the player.

## Development & Assets
- Built with **Unity**
- Player progression stored using **PlayerPrefs**
- Asset pack(s) sourced from online marketplaces
- Designed for touch controls and mobile UX

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Data Storage:** PlayerPrefs
- **Platform:** Android (Google Play)

## What I Learned
- Implementing inventory systems with item persistence
- Designing player–world interaction systems (tools, terrain, harvesting)
- Creating a simple in–game economy loop (buy → plant → harvest → sell → upgrade)
- 2D character controller and physics
- Using Unity’s terrain tools and tilemaps for level building

## Notes
This was one of the most complex game systems I had built at the time and significantly improved my understanding of programming architecture, state management, and player feedback loops.
